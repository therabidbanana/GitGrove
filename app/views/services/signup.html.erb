    If you think you already have an Omniauth pure account, and you were just trying to associate a new authentication with your existing account, then you’re in the wrong place. You’re not logged into Omniauth pure right now.
    </p>

    <p class="small nomargin">
        If you have a Omniauth pure account, and you’d like to associate another authentication with it, here’s what to do:
    </p>
    <ul class="small">
        <li>Log in in to Omniauth pure with your existing authentication service TODO</li>
        <li>Go to your settings page (located at the top/right corner of the page)
        <li>Add one or more accounts to be used to sign-in</li>
    </ul>
