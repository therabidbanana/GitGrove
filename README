# GitGrove

An easy way to host multiple Nanoc sites that auto update on git push and even
have a simple online interface for quick updates when you're away from your editor.

## Additional Setup

Sites are stored as repos, so you will need access to those repos. You can set up
a git user on your server to log in and push changes to the repos.

There is a configuration setting to allow you to set the storage path of repos,
we recommend you store them in your git user's home directory.
